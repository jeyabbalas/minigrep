# Basic grep CLI tool in Rust
This project implements a basic functionality grep CLI (command line interface) tool using Rust. This project is an exercise in Chapter 12 of [the official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). Rust is suited for developing CLI tools because it is fast, safe, and generates a single binary output with cross-platform support.

*Grep* (**g**lobally search a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint) is a classic command line tool, whose primary function is to search for a user-input string within a given file, and print the lines that contains the queried string.

## Implementation
1. Use [args() a standard library function](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.args.html) to accept command line arguments. Function returns an iterator of input arguments. Collect it into a collection. Save arguments needed for grep.
