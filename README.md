# Basic grep CLI tool in Rust
This project implements a basic functionality grep CLI (command line interface) tool using Rust. This project is an exercise in [Chapter 12 of the official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html).

*Grep* (**g**lobally search a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint) is a classic command line tool, whose primary function is to search for a user-input string within a given file, and print the lines that contains the queried string.

## Usage
Download the executable binary at ```./target/release/minigrep```. Run it in command line using the Terminal app in a macOS system as follows.

```
$> minigrep string_query filename.txt
```

Here, *string_query* is a string being searched in *filename.txt*, a text file. By default, the above command runs a case-sensitive search. To run case-insensitive search, set environment variable ```CASE_INSENSITIVE`` to any value, as shown below.

```
$> CASE_INSENSITIVE=1 minigrep string_query filename.txt
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Use [```args()``` a standard library function](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.args.html) to accept command line arguments. Function returns an iterator of input arguments. Collect it into a collection. Save arguments needed for grep.
2. Use [```read_to_string()```](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.read_to_string.html) to read the entire contents of a text file into memory as a string.
3. Extract out the parsing logic for input command line arguments as a constructor that returns a Result type. If number of arguments is less than 3 (function call, string query, filename), return an error; else return a struct with all program configuration variables.
4. Error handling in ```main()```: if constructor returns a struct, use it; else display a clean and helpful message and exit the program gracefully.
5. Move program logic (reading file contents) from ```main()``` into ```run()```. Return a Result type that returns unit type if everything went well, else return an Error type (use trait object that implies any type with ```std::error::Error``` trait).
6. Error handling in ```main()```: if ```run()``` returns an error, display a helpful message and exit gracefully.
7. Move arguments parsing and program logic to ```lib.rs```.
8. **Test-driven development**: Write a test to evaluate the as yet to be implemented method ```search()``` in ```lib.rs```, which returns lines in a text that contains a queried string. Implement an empty ```search()```, which fails. Implement minimal logic to pass the test.
9. Call ```search()``` from ```run()```.
10. Write tests for case-sensitive and -insensitive search function. Check if ```CASE_INSENSITIVE``` environment variable is set, if so, run case-insensitive search, else run case sensitive search.
11. Move error messages from standard output to standard error.
12. Function ```env::args()``` returns an iterator of type ```Args```. Make ```Config::new()``` take mutable ownership of this iterator (to consume with ```next()```) and directly move the values into ```Config``` by calling ```next()```.
13. Use iterator adapter methods to reduce the number of mutable states in ```search()``` i.e. progressively adding results to a mutable collection (vector). Functional programming style prefers fewer mutable states to make it concise and it makes concurrency easier.
